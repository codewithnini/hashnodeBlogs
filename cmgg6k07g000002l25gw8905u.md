### Database

It is a place or a medium in which we store the data in a systematic and organized manner.

The two important features provided by DBMS are

* Security
    
* Authorization
    

We use Query language to communicate or interact with DBMS .

DBMS stores the data in the form of files .

**Example** : Oracle RDBMS , IBM DB2 , Microsoft Azure etc. …

### There are various types of databases , each designed for specific uses or cases and requirements, here are some common type of databases.

## RDBMD - Relational Data Base Management System.

RDBMS is a type of DBMS Software which stores the data in the form of Tables " ( rows and column ) .

We use SQL to communicate or interact with RDBMS .

## Relational Model

* Relational Model was designed by **"Edgar F CODD"**
    
* The data must be stored in the form of rows and columns ( table ) .
    
* Any DBMS that follows the Relational Model becomes RDBMS.
    
* Any DBMS which follows rules of **EF CODD** becomes **RDBMS**.
    

### What is a Table ?

Table is a logical organization of data which consists of rows and columns.

### Columns

* Columns are also known as Attributes or Fields.
    
* A column is used to represent the properties of all the entities.
    

### Row

* Row is also known as Record or Tuples .
    
* A row is used to represent properties of an individual entity .
    

### Cell

* Cell is the smallest unit of the table in which we store the data .
    
* The intersection of rowsand columns generatese cell .
    

### RULES OF E.F CODD

* The data entered into a cell must be a single valued data ( ATOMIC ).
    
* In **RDBMS** we store everything in the form of **TABLES** , Including **METADATA** .
    
* According to **EF CODD** we can store the data in Multiple Tables . If necessary we can establish a connection between The tables using **Key Attributes** .
    
* The data entering the table can be verified in 2 steps
    
* By assigning Datatypes .
    
* By assigning Constraints.
    
* Datatypes are mandatory whereas constraints are Optional .
    

# Note : SQL is not a case sensitive language .

### DATATYPES

It is used to specify or determine the type / kind of data that Will be stored in a Particular memory location .

### Data types in SQL

* **CHAR**
    
* **VARCHAR** / **VARCHAR2**
    
* **NUMBER**
    
* **DATE**
    
* **LARGE OBJECTS**
    
    i. **CHARACTER LARGE OBJECT**
    
    ii. **BINARY LARGE OBJECT**
    

## 1\. **What is SQL?**

* **SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a standard language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in relational databases.
    
* SQL works with **RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems)** like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite, etc.

## 2\. **Types of SQL Commands**

SQL commands are mainly divided into **5 categories**:

### (A) **DDL – Data Definition Language**

Used to define and modify database structures (tables, schemas, indexes).

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CREATE` | Creates database/table | `CREATE TABLE Employee (id INT, name VARCHAR(50));` |
| `ALTER` | Modifies table structure | `ALTER TABLE Employee ADD salary DECIMAL(10,2);` |
| `DROP` | Deletes database/table | `DROP TABLE Employee;` |
| `TRUNCATE` | Removes all rows (but keeps structure) | `TRUNCATE TABLE Employee;` |

---

### (B) **DML – Data Manipulation Language**

Used for managing data inside tables.

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `INSERT` | Adds new records | `INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (1, 'John', 50000);` |
| `UPDATE` | Modifies existing records | `UPDATE Employee SET salary=60000 WHERE id=1;` |
| `DELETE` | Removes records | `DELETE FROM Employee WHERE id=1;` |

---

### (C) **DQL – Data Query Language**

* Mainly `SELECT` used to fetch data.
    

Examples:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee;
SELECT name, salary FROM Employee WHERE salary > 50000;
```

---

### (D) **DCL – Data Control Language**

Deals with **permissions** and **security**.

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GRANT` | Gives privileges | `GRANT SELECT ON Employee TO user1;` |
| `REVOKE` | Removes privileges | `REVOKE SELECT ON Employee FROM user1;` |

---

### (E) **TCL – Transaction Control Language**

Used to manage transactions.

| Command | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COMMIT` | Saves changes permanently | `COMMIT;` |
| `ROLLBACK` | Undo changes | `ROLLBACK;` |
| `SAVEPOINT` | Creates a checkpoint | `SAVEPOINT sp1;` |

---

## 3\. **SQL Clauses**

Some commonly used clauses:

* `WHERE` → filters rows
    
* `ORDER BY` → sorts results
    
* `GROUP BY` → groups rows by column values
    
* `HAVING` → applies conditions on groups
    

Example:

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM Employee
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY department;
```

---

## 4\. **SQL Constraints**

Used to set rules for columns in tables:

* `PRIMARY KEY` → unique & not null
    
* `FOREIGN KEY` → reference to another table
    
* `UNIQUE` → ensures unique values
    
* `NOT NULL` → column cannot be null
    
* `CHECK` → restricts values (e.g., salary &gt; 0)
    
* `DEFAULT` → assigns default value
    

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (salary > 0),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Department(id)
);
```

---

## 5\. **SQL Joins**

Used to combine rows from multiple tables.

| Join Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **INNER JOIN** | Returns matching rows from both tables | `SELECT` [`e.name`](http://e.name)`, d.dept_name FROM Employee e INNER JOIN Department d ON e.department_id =` [`d.id`](http://d.id)`;` |
| **LEFT JOIN** | All rows from left + matching from right | `SELECT` [`e.name`](http://e.name)`, d.dept_name FROM Employee e LEFT JOIN Department d ON e.department_id =` [`d.id`](http://d.id)`;` |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | All rows from right + matching from left | Same as above with RIGHT |
| **FULL OUTER JOIN** | All rows from both tables | Supported in some DBs |
| **CROSS JOIN** | Cartesian product | `SELECT * FROM Employee CROSS JOIN Department;` |

---

## 6\. **SQL Functions**

### (A) **Aggregate Functions**

Work on multiple rows.

* `COUNT()` → number of rows
    
* `SUM()` → total
    
* `AVG()` → average
    
* `MAX()` / `MIN()` → highest/lowest
    

Example:

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM Employee
GROUP BY department_id;
```

### (B) **Scalar Functions**

Work on individual values.

* `UPPER()` / `LOWER()`
    
* `LENGTH()`
    
* `ROUND()`
    
* `NOW()` (current date-time)
    

---

## 7\. **SQL Indexes**

* Used to **speed up data retrieval**.
    
* Example:
    

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON Employee(name);
```

---

## 8\. **SQL Views**

* Virtual table based on query result.
    

```sql
CREATE VIEW high_salary AS
SELECT name, salary FROM Employee WHERE salary > 50000;
```

---

## 9\. **SQL Stored Procedures**

* A set of SQL statements saved for reuse.
    

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeByDept(IN deptId INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE department_id = deptId;
END;
```

---

## 10\. **SQL Transactions Example**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Employee SET salary = salary + 5000 WHERE id = 1;

SAVEPOINT before_deduction;

UPDATE Employee SET salary = salary - 2000 WHERE id = 2;

ROLLBACK TO before_deduction;

COMMIT;
```

\========================================================================================================================================================

After opening workspace use below **statement** to see the available databases.

```sql
show databases;
```

You can create your database as well by use below **statement.**

```sql
create database sql_practice
```

for use the database write the statement below.

```sql
use sql_practice;
```

Lets see is there any table is there or not by write the statement below.

```sql
show tables;
```

If the database is empty we can create tables to practice by write the statement and its vary as per need.
