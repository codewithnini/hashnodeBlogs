# 👥 What is a Scrum Team? /Scrum

A **Scrum Team** is a small, cross-functional group of people who work together to deliver a product using the **Scrum framework** (an Agile methodology).

Scrum is built around teamwork, collaboration, and delivering value in short cycles (called **Sprints**).

---

## 📌 Characteristics of a Scrum Team

1. **Small size** → Usually **10 or fewer people**.
    
2. **Cross-functional** → The team has **all the skills needed** to build the product (developers, testers, designers, etc.).
    
3. **Self-managing** → They decide **how** to do the work (no micromanagement).
    
4. **Collaborative** → Everyone works together towards a **common goal**.
    
5. **Customer-focused** → They deliver working product increments every Sprint.
    

---

## 🛠️ Scrum Team Roles

A Scrum Team has **three defined roles**:

### 1\. **Product Owner (PO)**

* Represents the **customer and stakeholders**.
    
* Manages the **Product Backlog** (list of features, requirements, tasks).
    
* Decides **what** the team should build.
    

### 2\. **Scrum Master**

* A **coach/servant leader** for the team.
    
* Makes sure Scrum rules are followed.
    
* Removes obstacles (blocks) that slow the team.
    
* Helps improve processes and team collaboration.
    

### 3\. **Developers (Development Team)**

* Everyone who actually builds the product (coders, testers, designers, analysts, etc.).
    
* They decide **how** to implement the backlog items.
    
* Work together to deliver a **“Done” increment** by the end of each Sprint.
    

---

## 🌀 How a Scrum Team Works (Cycle)

1. **Sprint Planning** → Decide what to build in the next 1–4 weeks (Sprint).
    
2. **Daily Scrum (Stand-up)** → 15-minute meeting to sync progress.
    
3. **Sprint Work** → Build features, test, integrate, deliver.
    
4. **Sprint Review** → Show the product increment to stakeholders.
    
5. **Sprint Retrospective** → Team reflects and improves.
    

---

## 🎯 Goal of a Scrum Team

Deliver small, usable, working pieces of the product **every Sprint**, while continuously improving how they work together.

---

✅ **In short:**  
A **Scrum Team = Product Owner + Scrum Master + Developers**, working together in short cycles (Sprints) to deliver valuable software.

**Lets Introduce Scrum Team**

* **Product Owner** – Krishh
    
* **Scrum Master** – Arnav
    
* **Developer 1** – Dinesh
    
* **Developer 2** – Lucky
    
* **Tester** \- YOU(Nini)
    

# 🗓 What is Sprint Planning?

**Sprint Planning** is a **meeting that kicks off a new Sprint**.

* Happens at the **start of every Sprint**.
    
* Purpose: Decide **what will be done** in the Sprint and **how it will be done**.
    
* Time-boxed: Usually **2–4 hours for a 2-week Sprint**.
    

---

## 📌 Who Attends?

1. **Product Owner (PO)** → Explains priorities and backlog items.
    
2. **Scrum Master (SM)** → Facilitates the meeting, ensures Scrum rules are followed.
    
3. **Development Team** → Estimates work, plans tasks, commits to Sprint Goal.
    

---

## 🛠 Objectives of Sprint Planning

1. **Define Sprint Goal**
    
    * What is the **objective of this Sprint**?
        
    * Example: “Implement user login and registration functionality.”
        
2. **Select Backlog Items**
    
    * Product Owner presents **top-priority Product Backlog items**.
        
    * Team selects items they can **realistically complete**.
        
3. **Plan How to Do the Work**
    
    * Break stories into **tasks**.
        
    * Estimate effort for each task (hours, story points, or complexity).
        
    * Identify dependencies or blockers.

## 📊 Sprint Planning Process

| Step | Who | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1\. Present Backlog | PO | Show prioritized backlog items and explain goals |
| 2\. Define Sprint Goal | Team + PO | Decide the main objective for this Sprint |
| 3\. Select Stories | Development Team | Pick items that can be completed in Sprint |
| 4\. Break Down Tasks | Development Team | Divide stories into actionable tasks |
| 5\. Estimate Work | Development Team | Estimate effort and ensure workload is realistic |
| 6\. Commit to Goal | Team | Agree on Sprint Goal and selected items |

---

## ⚡ Tips for Effective Sprint Planning

* Only include **realistic amount of work** for the team’s capacity.
    
* Make the **Sprint Goal clear and achievable**.
    
* Keep backlog items **well-groomed and prioritized** before planning.
    
* Use **story points or time estimates** consistently.
    

# 🖼 Scrum Sprint Cycle Start-with Sprint 0.

## 🌀 Why Sprint 0 is shown in Scrum Sprint Cycle

**Sprint 0 is for preparation**

**Shows the full cycle**

**Helps plan better**

**Explains roles and work**

**Easy to understand for beginners.**

---

✅ **In short:**  
Sprint 0 is **the preparation Sprint**. It helps the team get ready so future Sprints can deliver real work smoothly.

## Let’s talk about **Sprint 0** — it’s a special type of Sprint in Scrum.

---

## 🌀 What is Sprint 0?

* **Sprint 0** is a **preparatory Sprint** before the first official Sprint.
    
* Purpose: **Set up the environment, tools, and planning** so that the team can start delivering real features in Sprint 1.
    
* Sometimes also called **Iteration 0**.
    

> Note: Sprint 0 **doesn’t usually deliver customer features**. Its goal is setup, planning, and foundation.

---

## 📌 Goals of Sprint 0

1. **Project Setup**
    
    * Install development tools, IDEs, frameworks, and libraries.
        
    * Set up **version control** (Git, SVN, etc.).
        
    * Configure build systems, CI/CD pipelines.
        
2. **Team Formation**
    
    * Introduce team members and define roles.
        
    * Agree on working agreements, communication channels, and responsibilities.
        
3. **Define Product Vision & Backlog**
    
    * Product Owner creates an **initial Product Backlog** with high-level features or user stories.
        
    * Define **Epic stories** for long-term planning.
        
4. **Architecture & Design**
    
    * Decide on high-level system architecture.
        
    * Define databases, APIs, integrations, tech stack.
        
5. **Spike or Research Tasks**
    
    * Explore **new technology, proof-of-concept, or prototypes**.
        
    * Helps reduce technical risk in future Sprints.
        
6. **Initial Estimations**
    
    * Estimate effort for backlog items (story points, hours, etc.).
        
    * Plan the first official Sprint.
        

---

## 🗓 Typical Sprint 0 Activities

| Activity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Project Kickoff | Team introduction, vision, objectives |
| Tool Setup | IDE, repos, CI/CD, dev environments |
| Backlog Creation | Product Owner lists initial features / epics |
| Architecture & Tech Decisions | Tech stack, design patterns, frameworks |
| Research / Spikes | Explore unknowns, prototyping |
| Planning | Define Sprint 1 scope, create initial tasks |

---

## ✅ Key Points

* Sprint 0 is **time-boxed** like a regular Sprint (usually 1 week or less).
    
* Output is **prepared environment + initial backlog**.
    
* Team **does not usually produce shippable features**.
    
* Avoid overloading Sprint 0 — focus on essentials to start Sprint 1.
    

---

✅ **In short:**  
**Sprint 0 = the setup Sprint** where the team prepares tools, backlog, architecture, and plans so that **Sprint 1 can focus on delivering real product increments**.

## ✅ Key Takeaways from the Diagram

1. **Sprint 0 is preparatory**: No real product features, only setup.
    
2. **Sprints 1, 2, 3…**: Regular Scrum Sprints delivering **shippable product increments**.
    
3. **Continuous Cycle**: Planning → Daily Scrum → Work → Review → Retrospective → Next Sprint.
    

# 📅 Sprint 0 – Duration and Daily Work

**Sprint 0** is a **preparation Sprint** before the first real Sprint.

* Duration: Usually **1 week** (can be 3–5 days depending on the team).
    
* Goal: Prepare everything so Sprint 1 can start smoothly.
    

## Main Agenda of Sprint 0 is:

### ✅ 1. Kick-off / Introduction

* Introduce team members (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers).
    
* Share backgrounds, skills, and roles.
    
* Build initial **team bonding**.
    

---

### ✅ 2. Understand Scrum Framework

* Quick overview of Scrum: values, roles, events, artifacts.
    
* Align everyone on **what Scrum is** and **why we’re using it**.
    

---

### ✅ 3. Define Product Vision

* **Product Owner** shares the **goal of the product/project**.
    
* Why are we building this? Who are the users? What problems are we solving?
    

---

### ✅ 4. Create Initial Product Backlog

* Brainstorm and list high-level features / user stories.
    
* Example (if building an e-commerce site):
    
    * User can **register/login**.
        
    * User can **search for products**.
        
    * User can **add to cart**.
        
    * User can **checkout**.
        

---

### ✅ 5. Team Agreements

* Decide **ways of working**:
    
    * Communication tools (Slack, MS Teams, Jira, Trello).
        
    * Working hours & availability.
        
    * Definition of Done (what makes work complete?).
        

---

### ✅ 6. Sprint 0 / Planning

* Plan the **first Sprint** (often called **Sprint 0** for setup).
    
* Decide what can realistically be delivered in 1–2 weeks.
    
* Assign initial backlog items.
    

---

### ✅ 7. First Agile Activity (Optional Fun)

* Run a **team-building exercise** (like Agile Ball Point Game, Marshmallow Tower, or simple ice-breakers).
    
* Helps everyone understand **collaboration & iteration**.
    

## 🗓 Daily Activities in Sprint 0 (Example – 1 Week)

\- Define Sprint Goal |

---

## 🔹 Key Points

* Sprint 0 **does not usually produce shippable features**.
    
* Focus is on **preparing the team, tools, backlog, and architecture**.
    
* Daily Scrum can be done in Sprint 0 for **tracking preparation work**.
    
* Output: Ready team, prepared backlog, tools installed, Sprint 1 planned.
    

---

✅ **In short:**  
**Sprint 0 = 1-week preparation phase.** Daily work includes **team setup, tool setup, backlog creation, architecture decisions, and Sprint 1 planning**.

# 🎯 Outcome of Sprint 0

* Everyone knows each other.
    
* The product vision is clear.
    
* There’s an **initial Product Backlog**.
    
* Team has a **working agreement**.
    
* Ready to start **Sprint 1**.
    

# Before Sprint -1 ,things need to know:

# 📋 What is Product Backlog?

A **Product Backlog** is a **list of all things that need to be done** to make a product.

* It is **created and maintained by the Product Owner (PO)**.
    
* Items in the backlog are called **user stories, features, or tasks**.
    
* The list is **prioritized**: most important items are at the top.
    

---

## 📌 Key Points About Product Backlog

1. **Dynamic** – It changes over time as requirements change.
    
2. **Prioritized** – High-value items come first.
    
3. **Detailed as Needed** – Top items are more detailed; lower items can be vague.
    
4. **Owned by Product Owner** – PO decides what goes into the backlog and in what order.
    

---

## 🗂 Example Product Backlog for E-commerce Website

| Priority | User Story / Feature |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | User can register/login |
| 2 | User can search products |
| 3 | User can add products to cart |
| 4 | User can checkout and pay |
| 5 | User can view order history |

---

## 🔹 How Product Backlog Works

* PO keeps updating it based on **customer feedback**.
    
* During **Sprint Planning**, the team picks items from the **top of the backlog** for the Sprint.
    
* It is **never complete**; new ideas and improvements are added continuously.
    

---

✅ **In short:**  
**Product Backlog = a prioritized list of all features, tasks, and requirements needed for a product, managed by the Product Owner.**

# 🌀 What is a Sprint?

A **Sprint** is a **short, fixed period of work** in Scrum.

* During a Sprint, the Scrum Team works to **deliver a usable piece of the product**.
    
* Time-boxed: Usually **1–4 weeks** (most common = 2 weeks).
    
* Goal: Complete specific tasks and produce a **working product increment**.
    

---

## 📌 Key Points About a Sprint

1. **Fixed time** – Once it starts, the duration does not change.
    
2. **Sprint Goal** – A clear objective for what the team wants to achieve.
    
3. **Deliverable** – A **shippable product increment** is produced by the end.
    
4. **Predictable Rhythm** – Sprints repeat one after another (Sprint 1 → Sprint 2 → …).
    

---

## 🗓 What Happens During a Sprint

1. **Sprint Planning** – Decide what to do and how to do it.
    
2. **Daily Scrum** – 15-minute daily meeting to track progress.
    
3. **Development Work** – Build features, test, integrate, and complete tasks.
    
4. **Sprint Review** – Show the working product to stakeholders and get feedback.
    
5. **Sprint Retrospective** – Reflect on what went well and what can improve.
    

---

## 🖼 Example

**Sprint Goal:** “Create user login and registration system.”

**Tasks in Sprint:**

* Design login page (1 day)
    
* Implement backend API (2 days)
    
* Connect frontend with backend (1 day)
    
* Test login and registration (1 day)
    

At the end of the Sprint, the team delivers a **working login system**.

---

✅ **In short:**  
A **Sprint = short, fixed-time cycle in Scrum where the team plans, works, tests, and delivers a working product increment**.

# 📝 What is a User Story?

A **User Story** is a **simple, short description of a feature or requirement** told from the **user’s point of view**.

* It explains **what the user wants** and **why**.
    
* Written in **plain language** (not technical).
    
* Helps the team understand the **value to the user**.
    

---

## 📌 Format of a User Story

A common template is:

👉 **As a \[user role\], I want \[something\] so that \[benefit\].**

---

## 🛒 Example (E-commerce App)

1. As a **customer**, I want to **search for products** so that I can **find what I need quickly**.
    
2. As a **customer**, I want to **add items to my cart** so that I can **buy multiple items at once**.
    
3. As an **admin**, I want to **manage inventory** so that I can **keep stock updated**.
    

---

## 🔹 Key Points About User Stories

* **Small & simple** (1–3 sentences).
    
* **Focus on user needs**, not technical tasks.
    
* **Prioritized** in the **Product Backlog**.
    
* Can be broken into **smaller tasks** for development.
    

---

✅ **In short:**  
A **User Story = a small requirement written in simple language from the user’s perspective, explaining what they want and why.**

# 🔢 What is a Story Point?

A **Story Point** is a **number that shows the size (effort) of a User Story**.

* It measures **how much work**, **complexity**, and **risk** are involved.
    
* It is **not about exact hours/days**, but a **relative estimate**.
    
* Teams use Story Points during **Sprint Planning** to decide how much work they can finish.
    

---

## 📌 Example

Imagine 3 User Stories:

1. **Login Page** → Easy (2 Story Points)
    
2. **Shopping Cart** → Medium (5 Story Points)
    
3. **Payment Gateway** → Hard (8 Story Points)
    

👉 Even though the team doesn’t say exact time (like 3 days or 5 days), they can compare:

* Cart (5) takes more effort than Login (2).
    
* Payment (8) is the most complex.
    

---

## 🧮 How Story Points Are Estimated?

* Scrum teams often use the **Fibonacci sequence** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …) because work grows in complexity.
    
* The team discusses and agrees on a number for each story.
    

---

## 🎯 Why Use Story Points?

1. To **plan Sprint capacity** (how many points fit in a Sprint).
    
2. To make estimation **faster and less stressful** (no debates about exact hours).
    
3. To focus on **relative difficulty**, not time tracking.
    

---

✅ **In short:**  
A **Story Point = a number that represents the relative effort, complexity, and risk of a User Story.**

# 📌 Difference Between Epic, User Story, and Task

## 1️⃣ **Epic**

* A **big feature or requirement** that is too large to finish in one Sprint.
    
* It is like a **chapter in a book**.
    
* Needs to be broken down into smaller **User Stories**.
    

👉 Example (Sales & Inventory Project):  
**Epic:** "Online Shopping Experience for Customers."  
(This includes login, browsing products, cart, checkout, etc.)

---

## 2️⃣ **User Story**

* A **small feature** from the user’s point of view.
    
* It is like a **page in the book**.
    
* Usually can be completed in **1 Sprint**.
    

👉 Example (from Epic above):

* *As a customer, I want to browse products so that I can select what to buy.*
    
* *As a customer, I want to add items to my cart so that I can purchase multiple products at once.*
    

---

## 3️⃣ **Task**

* The **technical steps** or activities needed to complete a User Story.
    
* It is like the **sentences in a page**.
    
* Done by developers/testers (implementation details).
    

👉 Example (for User Story: “Add to Cart”):

* Create database table for cart items.
    
* Develop “Add to Cart” API.
    
* Build front-end cart UI.
    
* Write test cases for cart functionality.
    

---

# 🗂 Hierarchy

* **Epic** → broken into → **User Stories** → broken into → **Tasks**
    

---

## 📊 Example from Sales & Inventory Project

**Epic:** "Manage Inventory"

* **User Story 1:** *As an admin, I want to add/edit products so that stock is updated.*
    
    * Task 1: Create product form UI
        
    * Task 2: Build product API
        
    * Task 3: Write test cases
        
* **User Story 2:** *As an admin, I want to track stock levels so that I can reorder items.*
    
    * Task 1: Create stock table in DB
        
    * Task 2: Build stock reporting module
        
    * Task 3: Integration testing
        

---

✅ **In short:**

* **Epic = Big feature (too large for 1 Sprint)**
    
* **User Story = Small feature (user-focused, fits in a Sprint)**
    
* **Task = Work steps (technical, developer-focused)**

## 📌 How This Helps

* **Epic** = Large feature (e.g., Online Shopping, Inventory Management)
    
* **User Story** = Smaller feature (e.g., Add to Cart, Manage Users)
    
* **Tasks** = Step-by-step technical work to build each User Story
    

---

👉 This table can directly be used in **Jira, Trello, or Azure DevOps** as backlog items.

✅ Let’s add a **Story Points column** so you can see how each User Story is estimated for effort. I’ll keep the **Tasks without points** (since tasks are just work steps), and put points only on **User Stories**.

## 🎯 How to Use in Sprints

* If your team capacity = **20 points per Sprint**, then:
    
    * **Sprint 1:** US1 (3) + US2 (5) + US3 (5) + US5 (5) + US8 (3) = 21 pts (✅ close fit)
        
    * **Sprint 2:** US4 (8) + US6 (8) + US7 (8) = 24 pts (✅ close fit)
