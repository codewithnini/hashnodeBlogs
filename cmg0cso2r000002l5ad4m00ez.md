## üîπ What is a Status Code?

A **status code** is a **3-digit number** sent by the server in response to a client‚Äôs request (like from a browser, Postman, or an API client).

It tells the **outcome of the request** ‚Äî whether it was successful, failed, redirected, or had some error.

Example:

* `200 OK` ‚Üí Request worked fine.
    
* `404 Not Found` ‚Üí The resource doesn‚Äôt exist.
    
* `500 Internal Server Error` ‚Üí Something went wrong on the server.
    

---

## üîπ Why is it Necessary?

Status codes are **necessary for communication** between client and server because they:

1. **Indicate Success or Failure**
    
    * Without codes, the client wouldn‚Äôt know if the request worked.
        
    * Example: `200 OK` means "everything fine," `401 Unauthorized` means "you need to log in."
        
2. **Help in Debugging**
    
    * Developers quickly identify where the issue is ‚Äî client-side or server-side.
        
    * Example: `400 Bad Request` ‚Üí issue with client request, `500` ‚Üí server problem.
        
3. **Enable Automation & Testing**
    
    * In **API automation testing**, we use assertions like:
        
        ```sql
        response.getStatusCode() == 200
        ```
        
        to check if API works as expected.
        
4. **Improve User Experience**
    
    * Users see meaningful error messages (like ‚ÄúPage Not Found‚Äù for `404`).
        
    * Prevents confusion if a request fails silently.
        
5. **Support REST Principles**
    
    * REST APIs rely on status codes to follow standard communication patterns.
        
    * Example:
        
        * `201 Created` ‚Üí when new resource is created.
            
        * `204 No Content` ‚Üí when resource deleted successfully.

## üîπ Analogy

Think of **status codes like traffic signals** üö¶:

* Green light (2xx) ‚Üí Go ahead (success).
    
* Yellow light (3xx) ‚Üí Redirect or wait (redirection).
    
* Red light (4xx, 5xx) ‚Üí Stop, something‚Äôs wrong (error).
    

HTTP status codes are grouped into 5 categories:

* **1xx** ‚Üí Informational
    
* **2xx** ‚Üí Success
    
* **3xx** ‚Üí Redirection
    
* **4xx** ‚Üí Client Errors
    
* **5xx** ‚Üí Server Errors

# üìò HTTP Status Codes with Use Cases
