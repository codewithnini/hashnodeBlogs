## ðŸ“˜ Git & GitHub for Automation Testers

## ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Git?

* **Git** is a **distributed version control system**.
    
* It helps track changes in code, collaborate with teams, and maintain different versions of a project.
    
* You work locally in your machine (Git repo), then push changes to a **remote repo** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    

ðŸ‘‰ **Why testers need Git?**

* To store **automation test scripts** (Selenium, RestAssured, Cypress, Playwright, etc.).
    
* To work in a **team** (developers + testers).
    
* To integrate with **CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)**.
    
* To maintain **version history** of test cases & frameworks.
    

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. What is GitHub?

* **GitHub** = cloud-based Git repository hosting service.
    
* Provides UI + collaboration features like Pull Requests, Code Reviews, Issues, Actions (CI/CD).
    

ðŸ‘‰ **Why testers need GitHub?**

* Store and share automation frameworks with team.
    
* Run **GitHub Actions pipelines** (for test execution).
    
* Collaborate with Dev/QA team using Pull Requests.
    
* Manage bugs/issues linked with test failures.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Git Workflow for Testers

A common workflow youâ€™ll use daily:

1. **Clone project** from GitHub
    
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    ```
    
    Example: cloning automation framework repo.
    
2. **Create new branch** (never work on main directly)
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/add-login-tests
    ```
    
3. **Make changes** â†’ Add new test scripts, update framework.
    
4. **Check status**
    
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    
5. **Stage changes**
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    
6. **Commit changes**
    
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Added login test cases"
    ```
    
7. **Push branch to GitHub**
    
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/add-login-tests
    ```
    
8. **Create Pull Request (PR)** in GitHub â†’ reviewed by team â†’ merged into `main`.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Common Git Commands for Testers

| Command | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `git clone <url>` | Copy repo from GitHub to local | `git clone` [`https://github.com/user/project.git`](https://github.com/user/project.git) |
| `git status` | Show changed files | `git status` |
| `git add <file>` | Stage file for commit | `git add` [`LoginTest.java`](http://LoginTest.java) |
| `git add .` | Stage all files | `git add .` |
| `git commit -m "msg"` | Save changes | `git commit -m "Added test cases"` |
| `git checkout -b <branch>` | Create new branch | `git checkout -b bugfix/login-issue` |
| `git checkout <branch>` | Switch branch | `git checkout main` |
| `git pull origin main` | Get latest changes | `git pull origin main` |
| `git push origin <branch>` | Push branch to remote | `git push origin feature/cart-tests` |
| `git log --oneline` | Show commit history | `git log --oneline` |
| `git diff` | Show code differences | `git diff` |

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Branching Strategy (Important in Companies)

Automation testers follow **branching models**:

* **main/master** â†’ Stable code (only reviewed code is merged).
    
* **develop** â†’ For ongoing development/testing.
    
* **feature branches** â†’ New test scripts or framework changes.
    
* **bugfix branches** â†’ Fixing test failures/defects.
    

ðŸ‘‰ Example for automation project:

* `feature/login-tests` â†’ you add login scripts.
    
* `feature/api-order-tests` â†’ API automation test cases.
    

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. GitHub Features for Testers

1. **Pull Requests (PRs)** â†’ code review before merge.
    
2. **Issues** â†’ bug tracking & linking with test failures.
    
3. **Projects** â†’ Agile boards (Kanban/Scrum for QA tasks).
    
4. **GitHub Actions** â†’ run Selenium/TestNG/RestAssured tests automatically.
    

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Real Use Cases in Automation Testing

âœ… **Selenium Framework**:

* Store Selenium + TestNG/Maven framework in GitHub.
    
* Team pulls latest test code daily.
    
* Jenkins/GitHub Actions runs tests automatically on push.
    

âœ… **API Testing with RestAssured**:

* Store API test cases in Git repo.
    
* Run them in CI/CD whenever backend deploys new code.
    

âœ… **Test Data Management**:

* Keep property files, JSON data, Excel test data in repo.
    
* Everyone uses same version-controlled data.
    

âœ… **Version Control**:

* Rollback to earlier commit if new test cases are failing.
    

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Interview-Focused Explanation

**Q: Why should an automation tester use Git/GitHub?**  
ðŸ‘‰ "As a tester, I use Git/GitHub to collaborate with the team, maintain version-controlled automation frameworks, and integrate test execution with CI/CD pipelines. It ensures everyone works on the latest code, avoids conflicts, and keeps a clean history of test script changes."

---

âœ… **Summary for Testers**:

* **Git** = Version control tool (local).
    
* **GitHub** = Remote repo + collaboration + CI/CD.
    
* Youâ€™ll use Git commands daily to manage automation frameworks.
    
* In interviews, focus on **branching, merging, PRs, CI/CD integration**.
