# 🌱 What is Agile?

**Agile** is a **software development approach** (and also a mindset) where work is done in **small, iterative cycles** instead of delivering everything at once at the end.

It focuses on:

* **Customer collaboration** (working closely with the client).
    
* **Flexibility** (adapting to changes easily).
    
* **Small, quick deliveries** (working software delivered frequently).
    
* **Teamwork & communication** (continuous interaction between team members).
    

---

## 📜 Agile Manifesto (Core Values)

Agile is based on **4 main values**:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
    
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
    
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
    
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.
    

---

## 🔑 Agile Principles (some key ones)

* Deliver working software **frequently** (short cycles, usually 1–4 weeks).
    
* Welcome **changes**, even late in development.
    
* Work **together daily** (developers, testers, business, customer).
    
* Build projects around **motivated individuals**.
    
* Maintain a **sustainable pace** (avoid burnout).
    
* Focus on **simplicity** – maximize work not done.
    
* Reflect and improve through **regular retrospectives**.

## ⚙️ Agile Frameworks / Methods

Agile itself is a philosophy, but it has different **frameworks**:

* **Scrum** → Iterations called *Sprints* (most popular).
    
* **Kanban** → Continuous flow, visualized with boards.
    
* **XP (Extreme Programming)** → Focus on coding practices.
    
* **Lean** → Eliminating waste, continuous improvement.
    

---

## 🏆 Why Agile?

* Faster delivery of working features.
    
* Easy to adapt to client/business changes.
    
* Continuous feedback improves quality.
    
* Better teamwork and ownership.
    
* Higher customer satisfaction.
    

---

👉 In short:  
**Agile = a flexible, customer-focused, iterative way of developing software where teams deliver value in small increments and improve continuously.**

# 🔑 Difference Between **Agile** and **Waterfall**

| Feature | **Waterfall Model** | **Agile Model** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Approach** | Linear and sequential (step by step). | Iterative and incremental (small cycles). |
| **Phases** | Requirement → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment (each must finish before next starts). | All activities (req., dev, test, deploy) happen in short cycles (sprints). |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid – hard to make changes once project starts. | Flexible – changes can be accepted even late in development. |
| **Delivery** | Final product delivered at the end. | Working product delivered in every sprint (1–4 weeks). |
| **Customer Involvement** | Customer involved at start (requirements) and end (delivery). | Customer involved continuously (reviews, feedback each sprint). |
| **Testing** | Happens after development is complete. | Happens continuously within each sprint. |
| **Risk** | High risk – issues found late in cycle. | Low risk – early detection of issues due to frequent testing/feedback. |
| **Best For** | Projects with clear, fixed requirements (e.g., government projects, construction). | Projects with changing requirements (e.g., web apps, startups, banking apps). |

## 📌 Example

* **Waterfall:** Building a house – you must finish foundation before walls, then roof, no going back easily.
    
* **Agile:** Developing a mobile app – you release small features (login, profile, chat) in sprints and improve based on feedback.
    

---

👉 In short:

* **Waterfall = plan-driven, rigid, one big delivery.**
    
* **Agile = adaptive, flexible, small frequent deliveries.**
    

👍 Let’s take the **Guru99 Bank project** and compare how it would look in **Waterfall vs Agile**:

---

## 🏗️ Guru99 Bank in **Waterfall**

1. **Requirements Phase** → Collect all features (Login, Account Mgmt, Fund Transfer, Balance Enquiry, etc.) at the start.
    
2. **Design Phase** → Create complete system design, database schema, and UI mockups for *all modules*.
    
3. **Development Phase** → Developer codes everything at once (all features).
    
4. **Testing Phase** → Tester tests only after all coding is complete (end of project).
    
5. **Deployment** → Deliver entire system in one go to the customer.
    

⚠️ Risk: If the customer changes a requirement (e.g., Fund Transfer rule), you discover it **late** and need rework.

---

## 🚀 Guru99 Bank in **Agile**

* Work divided into **sprints (1–2 weeks each)**.
    
* Customer sees working product after each sprint and gives feedback.
    

### Example Sprint Plan:

* **Sprint 1:** Login Module (valid/invalid login).
    
* **Sprint 2:** Account Management (create/delete account).
    
* **Sprint 3:** Fund Transfer (with rules & error handling).
    
* **Sprint 4:** Balance Enquiry + Regression + Final Release.
    

✅ Benefits:

* Customer gets **quick value** after Sprint 1 (Login works).
    
* Changes (like new transfer rules) can be added in next sprint.
    
* Testing & feedback are continuous → less risk of big surprises.
    

---

👉 **Key takeaway:**

* **Waterfall:** *Big bang delivery* → slow feedback, rigid.
    
* **Agile:** *Small incremental deliveries* → faster feedback, flexible.

Here’s a **visual comparison**:

* **Waterfall (left):** Linear flow, one phase after another.
    
* **Agile (right):** Iterative cycle, repeating phases with continuous feedback.
    

👉 This shows why Agile is more flexible compared to Waterfall.

Perfect 👍 Let’s build a **sample Jira backlog + sprint plan** for the **Guru99 Bank Project (Agile)** with your team setup (1 Dev, 1 Tester, 1 PO, 1 SM).
