# 📌 Manual Testing

---

## Basics of Manual Testing

* **What is Manual Testing?**  
    Testing software manually without automation tools. Tester acts like an end-user.
    
* **Why Manual Testing?**  
    ✔️ Useful for small projects  
    ✔️ Early-stage testing  
    ✔️ Exploratory & usability testing  
    ✔️ Validating look & feel
    

---

## Types of Testing

### 🔹 Based on Functionality

* **Functional Testing** → Verify features against requirements.
    
* **Integration Testing** → Verify modules work together.
    
* **System Testing** → End-to-end testing of whole application.
    
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** → Tested by end users.
    

### 🔹 Based on Knowledge

* **Black Box Testing** → No code knowledge (focus on input/output).
    
* **White Box Testing** → Code-level testing.
    
* **Grey Box Testing** → Mix of both.
    

### 🔹 Based on Execution

* **Smoke Testing** → Basic checks (is build stable?).
    
* **Sanity Testing** → Quick test of specific functionality after fix.
    
* **Regression Testing** → Re-test old features after new changes.
    
* **Retesting** → Re-check failed test cases.
    

### 🔹 Other Types

* **Performance Testing** (load, stress, volume).
    
* **Security Testing**.
    
* **Usability Testing**.
    
* **Exploratory Testing**.
    
* **Ad-hoc Testing**.

7. **Reopen** → If issue persists.
    
8. **Deferred/Rejected** → If not valid or postponed.
    

---

## Test Case Design Techniques

* **Equivalence Partitioning (EP)** → Divide input into valid/invalid sets.
    
* **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** → Test values at limits (min, max, just inside/outside).
    
* **Decision Table Testing** → Combination of inputs.
    
* **State Transition Testing** → System states & transitions.
    
* **Error Guessing** → Based on tester’s experience.

# 🌱 What is Agile?

**Agile** is a **software development approach** (and also a mindset) where work is done in **small, iterative cycles** instead of delivering everything at once at the end.

It focuses on:

* **Customer collaboration** (working closely with the client).
    
* **Flexibility** (adapting to changes easily).
    
* **Small, quick deliveries** (working software delivered frequently).
    
* **Teamwork & communication** (continuous interaction between team members).
    

---

## 📜 Agile Manifesto (Core Values)

Agile is based on **4 main values**:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
    
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
    
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
    
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.
    

---

## 🔑 Agile Principles (some key ones)

* Deliver working software **frequently** (short cycles, usually 1–4 weeks).
    
* Welcome **changes**, even late in development.
    
* Work **together daily** (developers, testers, business, customer).
    
* Build projects around **motivated individuals**.
    
* Maintain a **sustainable pace** (avoid burnout).
    
* Focus on **simplicity** – maximize work not done.
    
* Reflect and improve through **regular retrospectives**.
    

---

## ⚙️ Agile Frameworks / Methods

Agile itself is a philosophy, but it has different **frameworks**:

* **Scrum** → Iterations called *Sprints* (most popular).
    
* **Kanban** → Continuous flow, visualized with boards.
    
* **XP (Extreme Programming)** → Focus on coding practices.
    
* **Lean** → Eliminating waste, continuous improvement.
    

---

## 🏆 Why Agile?

* Faster delivery of working features.
    
* Easy to adapt to client/business changes.
    
* Continuous feedback improves quality.
    
* Better teamwork and ownership.
    
* Higher customer satisfaction.
    

---

👉 In short:  
**Agile = a flexible, customer-focused, iterative way of developing software where teams deliver value in small increments and improve continuously.**

# 🔑 Difference Between **Agile** and **Waterfall**

| Feature | **Waterfall Model** | **Agile Model** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Approach** | Linear and sequential (step by step). | Iterative and incremental (small cycles). |
| **Phases** | Requirement → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment (each must finish before next starts). | All activities (req., dev, test, deploy) happen in short cycles (sprints). |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid – hard to make changes once project starts. | Flexible – changes can be accepted even late in development. |
| **Delivery** | Final product delivered at the end. | Working product delivered in every sprint (1–4 weeks). |
| **Customer Involvement** | Customer involved at start (requirements) and end (delivery). | Customer involved continuously (reviews, feedback each sprint). |
| **Testing** | Happens after development is complete. | Happens continuously within each sprint. |
| **Risk** | High risk – issues found late in cycle. | Low risk – early detection of issues due to frequent testing/feedback. |
| **Best For** | Projects with clear, fixed requirements (e.g., government projects, construction). | Projects with changing requirements (e.g., web apps, startups, banking apps). |

---

## 📌 Example

* **Waterfall:** Building a house – you must finish foundation before walls, then roof, no going back easily.
    
* **Agile:** Developing a mobile app – you release small features (login, profile, chat) in sprints and improve based on feedback.
    

---

👉 In short:

* **Waterfall = plan-driven, rigid, one big delivery.**
    
* **Agile = adaptive, flexible, small frequent deliveries.**
    

👍 Let’s take the **Guru99 Bank project** and compare how it would look in **Waterfall vs Agile**:

---

## 🏗️ Guru99 Bank in **Waterfall**

1. **Requirements Phase** → Collect all features (Login, Account Mgmt, Fund Transfer, Balance Enquiry, etc.) at the start.
    
2. **Design Phase** → Create complete system design, database schema, and UI mockups for *all modules*.
    
3. **Development Phase** → Developer codes everything at once (all features).
    
4. **Testing Phase** → Tester tests only after all coding is complete (end of project).
    
5. **Deployment** → Deliver entire system in one go to the customer.
    

⚠️ Risk: If the customer changes a requirement (e.g., Fund Transfer rule), you discover it **late** and need rework.

---

## 🚀 Guru99 Bank in **Agile**

* Work divided into **sprints (1–2 weeks each)**.
    
* Customer sees working product after each sprint and gives feedback.
    

### Example Sprint Plan:

* **Sprint 1:** Login Module (valid/invalid login).
    
* **Sprint 2:** Account Management (create/delete account).
    
* **Sprint 3:** Fund Transfer (with rules & error handling).
    
* **Sprint 4:** Balance Enquiry + Regression + Final Release.
    

✅ Benefits:

* Customer gets **quick value** after Sprint 1 (Login works).
    
* Changes (like new transfer rules) can be added in next sprint.
    
* Testing & feedback are continuous → less risk of big surprises.
    

---

👉 **Key takeaway:**

* **Waterfall:** *Big bang delivery* → slow feedback, rigid.
    
* **Agile:** *Small incremental deliveries* → faster feedback, flexible.
    

Here’s a **visual comparison**:

* **Waterfall (left):** Linear flow, one phase after another.
    
* **Agile (right):** Iterative cycle, repeating phases with continuous feedback.
    

👉 This shows why Agile is more flexible compared to Waterfall.

Perfect 👍 Let’s build a **sample Jira backlog + sprint plan** for the **Guru99 Bank Project (Agile)** with your team setup (1 Dev, 1 Tester, 1 PO, 1 SM).

| Task | Test login functionality | Sprint 1 | QA |
| Story | Create Account | Sprint 2 | Dev |
| Task | Test account creation | Sprint 2 | QA |
| Story | Fund Transfer | Sprint 3 | Dev |
| Bug | Transfer fails when balance is enough | Sprint 3 | Dev |
| Story | Balance Enquiry | Sprint 4 | Dev |
| Task | Regression Testing | Sprint 4 | QA |

---

👉 This structure in Jira gives you:

* **Epics** = modules
    
* **Stories** = user requirements
    
* **Tasks** = Dev/QA work items
    
* **Bugs** = logged during testing
    

Here’s a **mock Jira Scrum board** for **Sprint 1** of the Guru99 Bank project:

* **To Do:** Setup Maven/Jira/Git, Implement Login Backend
    
* **In Progress:** Error handling for invalid login
    
* **Testing:** Test login (valid/invalid)
    
* **Done:** Configure Test Framework
    

👉 This shows how work items flow across columns during the sprint.

## If you are working as a **Manual + Automation Tester** in a **Scrum model using Jira**, you should focus on the **tester-related Jira concepts** that will help you manage testing activities, track bugs, and collaborate in sprints.

# 📌 Jira Concepts for Testers (Manual + Automation) in Scrum

## 1️⃣ **Jira Basics**

* How to navigate **Jira dashboard, backlog, and active sprint board**.
    
* Understanding **Epics, Stories, Tasks, Bugs, Sub-tasks**.
    
* Jira **workflow**: *To Do → In Progress → Testing → Done*.
    
* Using **filters & JQL (Jira Query Language)** to search issues.
    

---

## 2️⃣ **Working with Agile Boards**

* **Scrum Board:** Track sprint progress (Daily Scrum updates).
    
* **Kanban Board:** Continuous workflow view (sometimes used for QA tasks).
    
* **Burndown chart:** Understand sprint progress & velocity.
    

---

## 3️⃣ **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria**

* Read and understand **user stories** written by PO.
    
* Ensure **acceptance criteria** are clear for testing.
    
* Link **test cases** (manual/automation) to user stories.
    

---

## 4️⃣ **Test Management in Jira**

(Jira itself doesn’t have built-in test management, but many companies use **plugins like Zephyr, Xray, TestRail**).

* Create and execute **test cases** in Jira (via plugins).
    
* Maintain **test cycles** (Regression, Smoke, Sprint Testing).
    
* Link **defects** to user stories or requirements.
    

---

## 5️⃣ **Bug Tracking**

* Create a **Bug issue** in Jira with proper details:
    
    * Steps to reproduce
        
    * Expected vs Actual result
        
    * Screenshots/logs
        
    * Severity & Priority
        
* Track bug status until it’s fixed and retested.
    
* Link bug → test case → user story (traceability).
    

---

## 6️⃣ **Automation Integration**

* Link **automation test results** to Jira using CI/CD tools (like Jenkins).
    
* Example: When Selenium + TestNG suite runs, results update in Jira (via plugins or APIs).
    
* Create sub-tasks in Jira for **automation scripting**.
    
* Report failed automated tests as **bugs** in Jira.
    

---

## 7️⃣ **Reporting & Metrics**

* Use **Jira reports**:
    
    * Sprint burndown chart
        
    * Velocity chart
        
    * Defect report (bugs per sprint)
        
* Use dashboards for **QA visibility** (open bugs, test execution progress).
    

---

# ✅ In Short (For Testers in Jira + Scrum)

1. Understand **user stories, epics, tasks, bugs**.
    
2. Learn **test case management plugins (Zephyr/Xray)**.
    
3. Practice **bug creation, linking, tracking**.
    
4. Know how to **track sprint progress** with charts.
    
5. Automate and **integrate results with Jira** (if doing automation).
    

# 🧭 Jira Navigation Guide

## 1️⃣ Jira **Dashboard**

The **Dashboard** is your **home page** in Jira. It gives you a quick view of project health.

🔹 How to Navigate:

* Log in → On top menu, click **Dashboards**.
    
* You’ll see either:
    
    * **Default System Dashboard** (basic gadgets like “Assigned to Me”).
        
    * Or a **custom team dashboard** (created by Scrum Master/PO).
        

🔹 Key Sections for Testers:

* **Assigned to Me** → Your stories, bugs, test cases.
    
* **Created vs Resolved Chart** → Shows bug trends.
    
* **Sprint Burndown** → Sprint progress.
    
* **Test Execution Progress** (if using Zephyr/Xray plugin).
    
* **Pie Chart of Bugs by Status** → How many bugs are Open, In Progress, Done.
    

💡 *Tip:* You can create your own **QA Dashboard** → add gadgets like Bug Distribution, Test Coverage, etc.

    ## Got it 👍 Let’s break down **Epics, Stories, Tasks, Bugs, and Sub-tasks** in **Scrum with Jira context**.
    
    ---
    
    # 🧩 Jira Issue Types in Scrum
    
    ## 1️⃣ **Epic**
    
    * **What it is:** A **large feature or goal** that is too big to finish in a single sprint.
        
    * **Timeframe:** Usually spans multiple sprints (weeks/months).
        
    * **Example (Guru99 Bank):** *“User Account Management”* (covers login, registration, profile, logout).
        
    * **In Jira:** Purple-colored issue type, parent to multiple stories.
        
    
    ---
    
    ## 2️⃣ **Story (User Story)**
