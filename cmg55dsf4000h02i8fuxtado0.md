## **What is software?**

‚Ä¢ A Software is a collection of computer programs that helps us to perform a task.

**‚Ä¢ Types of Software:**

‚Ä¢ **System software** Ex: Device drivers, OS, Servers, Utilities, etc.

‚Ä¢ **Programming software** Ex: compilers, debuggers, interpreters, etc.

‚Ä¢ **Application software** Ex: industrial automation, business software, games, telecoms, etc.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Types of **Software Applications**

### A. Based on Platform

1. **Desktop Applications**
    
    * Installed and run locally on a PC/laptop.
        
    * Example: MS Word, Photoshop, VLC Media Player.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? Because they don‚Äôt require internet (except for updates), and execution happens on the user‚Äôs machine.
        
2. **Web Applications**
    
    * Accessed through a browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
        
    * Hosted on a server, not installed locally.
        
    * Example: Gmail, Facebook, Amazon, Jira.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? Because all business logic runs on a server, and the client (browser) just sends requests & shows responses.
        
3. **Mobile Applications**
    
    * Installed on mobile devices (iOS/Android).
        
    * Example: WhatsApp, Uber, Instagram.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? Designed for mobile OS with touch, push notifications, GPS, etc.
        
4. **Hybrid Applications**
    
    * Combination of web + mobile (single codebase runs on multiple platforms).
        
    * Example: Twitter app, Uber app.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? Built using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) but wrapped for mobile devices.
        

---

### B. Based on Functionality

1. **System Software**
    
    * Manages hardware & system resources.
        
    * Example: Windows OS, Linux, Drivers.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? Because it supports and runs other applications.
        
2. **Application Software**
    
    * Helps users perform tasks.
        
    * Example: MS Office, Photoshop.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? Directly used by end-users for productivity.
        
3. **Utility Software**
    
    * Provides supporting tools.
        
    * Example: Antivirus, File Compression tools.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? Assists system/application software with maintenance.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Types of **Web Applications**

Web apps themselves can be categorized further:

1. **Static Web Applications**
    
    * Only display content, no interaction.
        
    * Example: Simple portfolio website, company info page.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? HTML/CSS only, no DB or backend logic.
        
2. **Dynamic Web Applications**
    
    * Interactive, connected with database.
        
    * Example: Facebook, Twitter.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? Data changes dynamically based on user input.
        
3. **E-commerce Applications**
    
    * Online shopping systems.
        
    * Example: Amazon, Flipkart.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? Because they involve product catalog, payment gateway, cart system.
        
4. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**
    
    * Allow non-technical users to manage content.
        
    * Example: WordPress, Joomla.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? Designed to handle blogs, websites easily.
        
5. **Portal Web Applications**
    
    * Provide information in a categorized way.
        
    * Example: University student portal, Job portal.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? Because they serve role-based access to multiple modules.
        
6. **Single Page Applications (SPA)**
    
    * Works like a mobile app, loads once, then updates dynamically.
        
    * Example: Gmail, Trello.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? Built using Angular, React, Vue; fast and smooth UX.
        
7. **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**
    
    * Web apps that behave like mobile apps (offline support, push notifications).
        
    * Example: Twitter Lite, Starbucks PWA.
        
    * ‚úÖ Why? They combine best of web and mobile.

## What is Software Testing?

‚Ä¢ Software Testing is a part of software development process.

‚Ä¢ Software Testing is an activity to detect and identify the defects in the software.

‚Ä¢ The objective of testing is to release quality product to the client.

As we know Testing the functionallity of an application according to **CRS (Customer Requirement Specification)** is called **Software Testing**.

**Software Testing can be done by two way.**

1. Manual Testing
    
2. Automation Testing
    

## **üëâ NOTE: Here i explain about Web-Automation Only , not others.**

## Types of Testing in Web Automation.

### Classification of Different Types of Testing

**Testing is divided into two types ‚Äì**

* **Functional Testing**
    
* **Non Functional** **Testing**
